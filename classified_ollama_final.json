Despite claiming 'angel investor' status in tweet, context reveals this refers to early positions in memecoins/tokens (specifically '$AI' token on Solana), not equity funding of startups. Bio emphasizes Solana blockchain, memes, and transaction fees. Tweet contains Solana contract address and trading metrics (low cap, volume, sells) typical of speculative crypto trading, not venture deal flow or portfolio management.",
